# Node.js WordPress Command Line Wrapper

A littleThis is a small Node.js wrapper used to asynchronously interact with the WP-CLI, which is the command line interface for WordPress.

## Introduction

The purpose of this application is to help users to write routines using the WP-CLI without needing to write commands directly on the bash. By using this application you're also able to create business logic to interact with your WordPress instance in high level.

## Install

To install this application you just have to run a npm install and everything will be (almost) ready for use.

## Configuration

The only needed configuration here is to set at the variables.env file the path to your WordPress instance on the PATH environment variable.

## Usage

You just have to run npm start and that's it.
